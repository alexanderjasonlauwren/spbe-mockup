# One codebase, two builds

The demo and the integration build are the same code with a different data
source. `VITE_DATA_SOURCE=mock` produces a static site with no backend;
`VITE_DATA_SOURCE=api` talks to the real service.

```
npm run build                          # demo (mock is the default)
VITE_DATA_SOURCE=api npm run build     # integration
```

## Why not two repositories

The mock coupling is confined to twenty-one feature API directories. A fork would
duplicate every page, component and layout *around* them — so each UI change
happens twice, and the demo is the copy nobody runs day to day. It breaks
quietly, and you find out in front of a client.

## The pattern

```
src/features/<feature>/api/
  contract.ts          the interface both adapters satisfy
  <feature>Api.mock.ts the mock database
  <feature>Api.http.ts the real API
  <feature>Api.ts      picks one, at build time
```

**Both adapters return domain types.** The wire shape never escapes the HTTP
adapter — that mapping is what keeps components unaware of which source they are
running against, and it is where the English/Indonesian boundary lives
(`full_name` → `nama`).

**The contract is asserted in both adapters:**

```ts
const _contract: UsersApi = { getUsers, createOrUpdateUser, removeUser };
```

That line is not ceremony. Without it the mock returned a `UserEntity` and the
HTTP adapter returned the wire shape, and the mismatch surfaced only in whichever
page happened to read a field present in one and not the other.

## Features with no endpoint yet

Re-export the mock, and say so in the selector:

```ts
// Mock-only for now: the backend has no export endpoint yet.
export const exportUsers = mockApi.exportUsers;
```

An HTTP adapter that throws would be worse — it looks like an outage rather than
unbuilt work.

## Status

| Feature | Adapter | Mock-only exceptions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| auth | mock + http | — |
| bankaccounts | mock + http | — |
| dashboard | mock + http | composes financeApi.getAgingReport(), orderApi.getOrderTotals(), saApi.getSAList() and its own /deliveries fetches (today, yesterday, this month) rather than a new backend endpoint — every figure already had a real feature behind it once B2/B5/B6 landed. The dispatch rail's `hasSchedule` is false: no field for a stop's planned time of day exists anywhere in the schema, so stops position by real dispatch order instead of a fabricated clock, and `DispatchRail.tsx` stops drawing an hour ruler, a "now" line and a late verdict over a position that was never a real time. `getRecentAudit` always returns `[]` — nothing writes to `audit.audit_trails` on the real service, and the mock's own seed carries no rows either. |
| distribution | mock + http | the printed route sheet only (no per-stop address/time on the wire). Scheduling approved orders onto a plan is real as of D3 B-Step 2 — `addApprovedOrders` calls `orderApi.http.ts`'s own `scheduleOneOrder`, not a second copy of the request. |
| drivers | mock + http | a driver's today-only stop list (`getDriverSchedule`; the dispatch board is keyed by plan, not by driver) |
| orders | mock + http | `sisaKuotaOutlet` (an outlet's remaining monthly quota is not on `OrderResponse`; a real number would cost a lookup per row on a list screen — renders as unbounded rather than 0, which would wrongly flag every order as over quota) and `kecamatan` (the outlet's district; belongs to the outlet module, same "arrives as unknown" choice `distributionApi.http.ts` makes for a stop's own decoration). `approveOrder`'s `catatan` parameter has nowhere to go server-side (`ApproveRequest` carries no note field) and is silently dropped — no current caller passes one. `addOrdersToPlan` is no longer atomic the way the mock's `scheduleOrders` is: the real endpoint decides one order at a time, so a batch that fails partway through leaves the earlier ones already scheduled; the thrown error says how many. |
| finance | mock + http | an invoice row's surat jalan number (`InvoiceResponse` carries only the delivery's UUID); which invoices a payment was allocated to (no route returns allocation lines, only the total — see `financeApi.http.ts`'s own header); the credit note reason code (the dialog collects free text, the backend wants one of five fixed codes, so every note goes in as `billing_correction`); the trial balance's "Dari" date (the ledger's own trial balance is lifetime-to-date as of one date, not a range) |
| geofence | mock + http | — |
| monitoring | mock + http | — |
| notification | mock + http | per-rule `penerima` (who receives it) and `kanal` (channel) — `notify.reminder_settings` has one tenant-wide `channels` array and no recipients concept at all; reads as an empty/`["app"]` placeholder and is silently not persisted on save. `planUnconfirmed` and `orderPending` have no column in `notify.reminder_settings` at all — always read disabled, saving them changes nothing. `whatsapp`/`email` sender configuration and `sendTestNotification` have no backend (no send infrastructure exists; WhatsApp is explicitly out of scope for D3). A notification's `href` is always absent — `subject_id` on the wire is an internal numeric id, not a UUID any route can link to. |
| outlet | mock + http | an outlet's recent surat jalan (`getOutletHistory`; not exposed by the service) |
| products | mock + http | cost price and stock (quantity, low-stock flag, stock value) have no service behind them yet — `internal/controller/product` is a catalogue module only; see `productApi.http.ts`'s own header. `ProductView.stokTersedia` flags this so the console hides the panels rather than showing zero as real. |
| reports | mock + http | required a new backend endpoint (`GET /deliveries` — `core.deliveries` had no general list before D3 B-Step 5) alongside the adapter split; see `reportApi.http.ts`'s own header. `suratJalanSelesai`/`suratJalanTertunda` map onto the real 6-state `delivery_status` lifecycle (`delivered` / `pending`+`on_route`) rather than the mock's binary one — `partial`, `failed` and `cancelled` count toward neither, so the two no longer have to sum to `suratJalan`. `/payments` and `/invoices` have no date-range filter server-side, so both are fetched once at `MaxPageSize` (100, newest first) and the window is applied client-side, same limitation `financeApi.http.ts`'s own aging report already has; `/deliveries` itself is capped the same way for a range with more than 100 surat jalan. `namaPerusahaan`/`nomorAgen` on the printed recap read "—", the same placeholder `settingsApi`'s `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` already uses since neither field is owned by any endpoint. |
| sa (schedule agreements) | mock + http | — |
| settings | mock + http | exporting, resetting and advancing the simulated day (properties of the demo database, not a tenant) |
| sopir | mock + http | — |
| system | mock + http | suppliers are not a master table (per D3 plan's decision 5): the list is derived from `/schedule-agreements`' own `supplier_name`, with no code/address/contact fields and no create/edit/delete (the console hides those actions rather than offering ones that would fail). Numbering prefixes (`penomoran`) have no backend column at all — `core.document_sequences` fixes them at branch-creation time — so the panel shows the real, hard-coded prefixes as disabled fields rather than an editable form that saves nowhere. |
| tenancy | mock + http | — |
| transactions | mock + http | required a new backend endpoint (`GET /transactions`, joining a delivery to its plan, schedule agreement, invoice and funding payment in one query — `core.deliveries` had no such pre-joined read before D3 B-Step 6) alongside the adapter split; see `transactionApi.http.ts`'s own header. `statusKirim` and `statusBayar` (and `kecamatan` and free-text search) have no `eq`-only server-side filter that expresses the console's coarser buckets, so all four are applied client-side over one fetched page of up to 100 rows — same trade `getInvoices` already makes for its own status/bucket filters. `jamRencana` is always empty (no planned-time-of-day field exists anywhere in the schema, the same gap `monitoringApi.http.ts` already carries); an unbilled delivery's `nominal` reads 0 rather than the mock's catalogue-price estimate. |
| users | mock + http | export and audit trail (no backend endpoint yet) |
| vehicles | mock + http | — |
| ocr | mock only | no backend endpoint yet — no contract/mock/http split |

**A bug found live against the API build, fixed 2026-09-10:** `SettingsPage`
could hang on its loading skeleton forever with no visible error. Root
cause: `useScope()` calls `setActiveScope(scope)` unconditionally on every
render, computed from `tenantRegistry()` — filled asynchronously by the
layout's tenant-list query. Any render where that registry reads
momentarily empty (an HMR module reset while diagnosing this is one way it
was reproduced; the fix is not specific to that cause) wiped the module-level
acting tenant to `""`. Any query building a request path from
`getActingTenant()` synchronously at that instant — `SettingsPage`'s own
`getSettingsDetail` among them — failed with "Tidak ada tenant aktif", and
with this app's `retry: 0` default that failure was permanent, since
nothing re-ran the query once the registry recovered a render later.

Fixed two ways: `mocks/scope.ts`'s `setActiveScope` now refuses to regress
the acting tenant to empty once a real one has been set (the root-cause
fix, mutation-tested in `scope.test.ts`); `SettingsPage.tsx` also now
checks `settings.isError` before its `if (!form)` loading guard, so a
genuine failure — including the residual cold-start case this guard does
*not* cover (the very first render of a session, before any tenant has
ever loaded once) — shows an error with a retry action instead of an
eternal skeleton. Both verified live: reproduced the cold-start error on a
fresh session, confirmed "Coba lagi" recovers cleanly, then verified
`BankSection`'s full create/delete lifecycle inside the now-working page.

A "mock + http" row still throwing on the API build somewhere means an
exception was missed here. Every deliberate gap is named in its adapter file —
most guarded with `assertMockAllowed` so the API build shows the sentence that
explains the gap rather than invented data (`grep -rn assertMockAllowed
src/features`); a few (settings, users) are plain re-exports of a demo-only or
not-yet-built capability, commented in place — never a silent fallback either
way.
