/**
 * Authentication, against the real API.
 *
 * Login is deliberately two requests. `POST /auth/login` answers with tokens
 * and nothing else — no user, no permissions — because the token has to be
 * stored before anything can be read with it. `GET /profile` then answers who
 * the caller is and what they may do, using the token just stored.
 *
 * Permissions are read here rather than decoded from the JWT on purpose. A
 * token is valid until it expires, so grants baked into one would keep
 * authorising a role that had been revoked minutes ago. The server re-resolves
 * them per request; this reads the same tables at the same moment, so what the
 * console draws and what the server will allow come from one source.
