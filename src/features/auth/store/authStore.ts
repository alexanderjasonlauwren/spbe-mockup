/**
 * The session, as the console sees it.
 *
 * This store used to *be* the authentication: it read the mock user table
 * directly, compared against a hardcoded demo password and minted a fake JWT.
 * That made the API build unable to log in at all, which in turn meant none of
 * the HTTP adapters behind it had ever run.
 *
 * Now it holds session state and delegates every I/O decision to `authApi`,
 * which is the mock or the real service depending on the build. The demo
 * behaves exactly as before — same password, same messages — because that
 * behaviour moved into `authApi.mock.ts` rather than being deleted.
