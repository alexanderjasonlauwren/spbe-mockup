/**
 * Proposes which stops share a truck, for the demo build.
 *
 * A pure function over the rows already on screen: no database, no clock, no
 * network. That is deliberate -- the panel calls it while the planner is still
 * editing an unsaved draft, so anything requiring a round trip would only be
 * able to suggest against yesterday's saved state.
 *
 * **What this deliberately does not do is route.** The mock has no outlet
 * coordinates, so there is no distance to minimise and no honest way to order
 * the stops within a trip; it packs by capacity and orders by delivery hour,
 * which is the order the planner already typed. The service's planner does the
 * real thing -- Clarke-Wright savings over real coordinates -- and when the
 * distribution HTTP adapter lands it replaces this, not the panel around it.
 *
 * Saying so in `dasar` rather than presenting both as "the suggestion" is the
 * whole point: a proposal that claims a quality it does not have is worse than
 * no proposal, because the dispatcher stops checking it.
