/**
 * What every driver adapter must provide.
 *
 * # The model this contract does NOT have
 *
 * No `plat`, no `armada`, no `kapasitas`. `core.drivers` and `core.vehicles`
 * have no link column anywhere: the pairing lives on `core.dispatch_trips`,
 * because a driver swaps trucks and a truck swaps drivers. The console used to
 * collapse the two by putting the plate on the driver, which made "what is this
 * driver's capacity?" answerable — and the answer was wrong on any day they
 * took a different truck.
 *
 * Screens that want to show a driver with their truck read the vehicle list.
 * In the demo build that pairing is `mocks/fleet.ts`; against the service it is
 * the dispatch board, which is the only place it is real.
