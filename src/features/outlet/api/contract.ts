 *
 * **Adapters return domain types.** The wire shape never escapes the HTTP

/**
 * An outlet with the figures the screens put beside it.
 *
 * # Why `statistikTersedia` exists
 *
 * Five of these are computed from deliveries and invoices — modules the service
 * does not have yet. The alternative to a flag was reporting them as zero,
 * which is not a smaller lie: "0 tagihan tertunda" says this outlet owes
 * nothing, and "sisa kuota 0" says it may take no more cylinders. Both are
 * claims the API build cannot make, and both are exactly the sort a planner
 * acts on.
 *
 * A flag rather than five nullable numbers because the answer is the same for
 * all five and the screens show them together: the panel that cannot be filled
 * is hidden whole, which reads as "not available here" rather than as a row of
 * dashes that look like missing data.
 *
 * `nilaiTertunda` is the exception and is populated in both builds:
 * `credit_balance` is a column on the outlet, so what the outlet owes is known
 * even where the invoices behind it are not.
