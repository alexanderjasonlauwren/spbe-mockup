/**
 * What every product adapter must provide.
 *
 * Same reason as every other feature's contract: without one the mock and the
 * HTTP adapter drift, and the drift shows up only in whichever screen reads
 * the field one of them forgot.
 *
 * # Why `stokTersedia` exists
 *
 * `internal/controller/product` is real and mounted, but it is a catalogue
 * module, not a stock module: `core.products` has no quantity column, and
 * stock lives in `core.stock_levels`, which nothing serves yet. Cost/sell
 * pricing is a separate tiered resource but does have a write route now
 * (`POST /products/:id/pricing`) — only the stock half of the mock model is
 * still unbacked. Reporting a live count, a cost-based stock value, or a
 * low-stock flag against an API this build cannot ask would be a confident
 * zero standing in for "unknown" — the same lie `OutletView.statistikTersedia`
 * exists to avoid, and the same fix: a flag the screen checks to hide the
 * panel that cannot be filled, rather than a row of numbers that look like
 * data.
