/**
 * Gates a route on a permission, or on several.
 *
 * The sidebar hides what a role cannot use, but hiding a link is not access
 * control — a sopir who types /ledger reached the general ledger, which is the
 * whole finance position of the agency. `ProtectedRoute` only ever asked
 * whether someone was signed in.
 *
 * Renders a stated refusal rather than redirecting: a silent bounce to the
 * dashboard reads as a broken link, and leaves the person guessing whether the
 * page exists.
 *
 * # Why this takes a list
 *
 * Some endpoints require more than one permission, and `authorizer.Require` on
 * the backend is an AND. `GET /monitoring/board` wants both
 * `read.deliveries` and `read.gps_tracks`, because the board carries where a
 * named person is right now. Gating the route on the first alone let three
 * roles that hold it — warehouse_staff, finance_officer, auditor_viewer —
 * open a page whose only request answers 403.
 *
 * The prop shape mirrors `CanAccess` deliberately, rather than inventing a
 * second vocabulary for the same idea one directory apart.
