/**
 * The console gates on permission codes the backend defines.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-28 it gated on codes it had invented -- `sa:view` against the
 * backend's `distribution.read.schedule_agreements` -- and nothing connected the
 * two, so a button could be shown to someone the route would refuse. That is
 * fixed, and this is what stops it recurring: the vocabulary is now a shared
 * contract across two repositories, and a shared contract with no check is a
 * comment.
 *
 * The catalogue lives in the backend repo, so this test needs it on disk. When
 * it is absent -- CI for this repository alone, or a fresh clone -- the test
 * says so and skips rather than failing, because a red build for a missing
 * sibling checkout teaches people to ignore red builds.
