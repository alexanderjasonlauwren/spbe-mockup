/**
 * Permission codes, in the backend's vocabulary.
 *
 * These values used to be the console's own invention — `sa:view`,
 * `payments:verify` — while the backend authorises on `module.action.resource`
 * codes seeded from `seeds/03-permissions/catalogue.go`. Two vocabularies for
 * one concept: the console could gate a button on `sa:view` while the route it
 * calls required `distribution.read.schedule_agreements`, and nothing connected
 * the two. It went unnoticed only because the console had never authenticated
 * against the backend.
 *
 * The backend's codes win, and there is no translation table. A map between two
 * vocabularies has to be maintained by whoever adds the next permission, in a
 * file they have no reason to open, and the failure when they forget is a menu
 * item that answers 403.
 *
 * **Changing a value here is a real change.** Every guard reads these constants
 * — nowhere in the console writes a permission string literal — so a wrong value
 * hides a feature from everyone rather than breaking a build.
 *
 * @see seeds/03-permissions/catalogue.go — the catalogue these must match
