/**
 * Neutral defaults for fields no endpoint owns yet.
 *
 * `iam.tenant_settings` covers the lexicon and the operating window;
 * `iam.tenant_profiles` covers legal identity. SettingsEntity is wider than
 * both — numbering, notification rules, theme — and those have no endpoint. The
 * HTTP adapter merges over these rather than leaving them undefined and letting
 * a screen render blank.
 *
 * Written out rather than imported from `@/mocks/seed`, which is what the first
 * version did: that pulled the entire seed database — outlets, deliveries,
 * journals — into the API build's bundle, to read a handful of defaults.
 *
 * The lexicon falls back to colourless words on purpose. A brand-new session
 * shows these for the moment before settings load, and a neutral noun is better
 * than a confidently wrong industry's.
