/**
 * Fields a tenant inherits from its parent when it has not set them.
 *
 * The list follows the backend's `iam.tenant_settings` columns exactly, because
 * an inheritance badge is a promise about behaviour — showing one for a field
 * the API cannot carry would be a lie in the API build, and a demo-only truth in
 * the mock.
 *
 *   unit_term / outlet_term / supplier_term   -> istilah
 *   operating_hours_start / _end              -> jamOperasional*
 *   working_days, stop_duration_minutes,
 *   planning_lead_time_days, geofence_radius_m,
 *   record_driver_location                    -> operasi
 *
 * # Two fields that were on this list and should not have been
 *
 * `zonaWaktu` is `iam.tenant_profiles.timezone`, and profiles NEVER inherit — a
 * legal entity's timezone belongs with its registered address, not with how it
 * happens to work. The console was offering to inherit it while the backend
 * refused to, which is the two disagreeing about a rule rather than a value.
 *
 * `targetHarian` has no backend home at all. It is a console-side commercial
 * goal, so it inherits in the mock and could not in the API build.
