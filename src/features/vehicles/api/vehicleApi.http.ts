/**
 * The fleet, against the real API.
 *
 * A truck carries no personal data, so unlike drivers and outlets there is
 * nothing here that must not be logged — the whole row is as public as the
 * plate on the back of it.
 *
 * # Capacity in units, and sometimes in kilograms
 *
 * `capacity_qty` is NOT NULL and `capacity_kg` is not, and the difference is
 * configuration rather than a missing field: "unknown weight limit, check the
 * count only" is a real answer for a truck nobody has weighed. So the domain
 * type keeps `kapasitasKg` optional and the planner's ceiling stays the count.
