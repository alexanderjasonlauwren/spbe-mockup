/**
 * Every write in the console goes through this hook, and until now every one
 * of them invalidated every query in the app.
 *
 * That default is correct and stays: the feature APIs read one shared store,
 * so verifying a payment really does change the finance page, the dashboard's
 * pending count and the notification bell at once. What these tests pin is
 * that narrowing it is *opt-in* — a global narrowing would have been a silent
 * regression across twenty screens, each going stale in its own way and none
 * of them obviously related to this file.
