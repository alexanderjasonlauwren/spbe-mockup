/**
 * Every write in the console goes through here.
 *
 * Because all feature APIs read one shared store, a successful write can
 * invalidate everything: verifying a payment changes the finance page, the
 * dashboard's pending count, and the notification bell at once. It also gives
 * every action the same confirmation and failure voice.
 *
 * # Why invalidating everything is still the default
 *
 * It is correct and it is nearly free against the mock, where a refetch is a
 * read of an in-memory store. Narrowing it globally would be a silent
 * regression across twenty screens that rely on the broad sweep -- a payment
 * verified on one page would stop updating the bell on another, and nobody
 * would notice until someone complained about a stale number.
 *
 * `invalidate` is the opt-out, for the one screen where the sweep is
 * genuinely expensive: the monitoring board polls every thirty seconds and
 * draws a Leaflet map whose rounds are road-snapped through a router, so one
 * "Berangkat" press re-runs every one of those requests. Pass the keys that
 * actually changed there, and leave the default everywhere else.

 * a missing outlet code and a malformed phone number were the same message,
 * with nothing to say which field to look at.
 *
 * The field names are the wire's (`code`, `phone`), not the form's. Translating

 * renamed; naming the field the server named is worse copy and better help.
