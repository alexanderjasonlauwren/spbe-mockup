/**
 * The words this tenant uses for the things it moves.
 *
 * The console is not an LPG console. It plans rounds, loads vehicles, draws
 * against a quota and bills the receiver — none of which is specific to gas
 * cylinders. But every screen has to *call* those things something, and the
 * right noun is the tenant's, not ours: an LPG agency says pangkalan, tabung
 * and SPBE; a water depot says depot, galon and pabrik; a feed distributor
 * says toko, sak and pabrik.
 *
 * So the vocabulary is data. The code names the *role* (`outlet`, `supplier`,
 * `unit`) and asks this module for the tenant's word at render time. Nothing
 * below the UI layer should carry an industry noun as a literal.
 *
 * Module-level rather than a hook, mirroring `setActiveScope` in mocks/scope:
 * these are read from print templates, CSV headers and toast strings that are
 * not React components and cannot subscribe to anything.
 *
 * Where a single product *is* in scope — an invoice line, a stop's product
 * block — use that product's own `satuan` instead. `unitLabel` is the fallback
 * for totals that span products, not a replacement for the per-product word.
