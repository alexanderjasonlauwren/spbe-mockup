/**
 * Tenant and branch scoping.
 *
 * The backend enforces tenancy in the database — row-level security on 59
 * tables, with composite foreign keys making cross-tenant rows structurally
 * impossible. This is the frontend's equivalent: one place that narrows the
 * store, so no feature API has to remember to filter.
 *
 * # Reads travel down the tree; writes do not
 *
 * That asymmetry is the whole design and it is why there are two tenant fields
 * rather than one. A group can SEE its subsidiaries' rows — `visibleTenantIds`
 * — but everything it writes lands in the tenant it is ACTING as. To write
 * inside a subsidiary you switch into it, which is what makes that subsidiary's
 * invoice carry its own number series and its own tax identity.
 *
 * Mirrored from the backend exactly: `USING (tenant_id = ANY
 * (visible_tenant_ids()))` against `WITH CHECK (tenant_id =
 * current_tenant_id())`. If these two ever disagree, this file is the one that
 * is wrong.
 *
 * Branch may be null — "all branches I can see" — which is how a head office
 * gets consolidated figures.

 *
 * `useScope` calls this unconditionally on every render, computed from

 * layout's tenant-list query). `tenantRegistry()` can read empty for an
 * instant it never should have — an HMR module reset during development
 * is one way, but the guard is not specific to that cause; any transient
 * emptiness between two renders has the same effect. A query that reads
 * `getActingTenant()` synchronously during that instant (any `*Api.http.ts`
 * building a request path from it) fails with "Tidak ada tenant aktif" —
 * and with this app's `retry: 0` default, that failure is permanent, not
 * transient, because nothing re-runs the query once the scope recovers a
 * render later.
 *
 * Found live: `SettingsPage` hung on its own loading skeleton forever
 * against the API build, `settings.status` had actually moved to `"error"`
 * with exactly this message, and the page's `if (!form)` guard could not
 * tell that apart from still loading. This is the root-cause fix; see
 * SettingsPage.tsx for the belt-and-braces fix on the consumer side.
 *
 * Never legitimate to defend against: an intentional "no tenant" scope is
 * not a state this application has — every real switch names a tenant
 * explicitly (`useScope`'s `setTenant`), so a blank incoming value here is
 * always the transient case, never a deliberate one.
