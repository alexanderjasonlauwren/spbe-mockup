 * on iam.users to read — and nothing branches on those names. What a person may
 * do is `permissions`, resolved per request by the server from iam.user_roles.
 *
 * This union survives because the users LIST still shows a role column backed
 * by mock data. It is display vocabulary, and it should go when that list is
